    - makeImportHook is used to create an import hook ([link.js:354](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/compartment-mapper/src/link.js#L354)) TODO: describe what for

    - load calls `memoizedLoadWithErrorAnnotation` (ü§î See the deep dive) which recursively goes through modules in the compartment and adds them to the `pendingJobs`
    - `pendingJobs` are awaited for in a loop
    - errors don't propagate from jobs, they're collected in an array (each job has a catch for that)
    - if any errors were colleted, an Error is thrown containing details from all underlaying errors.
  - compartmentImportNow(*reference to the compartment itself*, specifier) after load
    - link is called from [module-link.js](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/ses/src/module-link.js#L37) (not the same link!)  
     `link` creates `ModuleInstances` and `ModuleNamespaces` for a module and its
     transitive dependencies and connects their imports and exports.
     After linking, the resulting working set is ready to be executed.

          - makeThirdPartyModuleInstance creates an instance for cjs modules
          - makeModuleInstance creates an instance for esm (and that's more complicated)
      > instantiate and link return: `{notifiers: {‚Ä¶}, exportsProxy: Proxy, execute: ∆í}`
    - execute is called from link (*no await, runs synchronously*)
      - [parse-cjs.js:28](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/compartment-mapper/src/parse-cjs.js#L28) execute is called (*but it's an async function*)
        - this is where the module code runs  
        - compartmentImportNow is called recursively for each require invoked by the module being executed
        - whatever execute returns, is being ignored (*for now, I guess*)
        

## Module instance and import

Let's take an example index.mjs

In [module-instance.js](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/ses/src/module-instance.js)  

`makeModuleInstance` is called to create an instance of index.mjs.  
`makeThirdPartyModuleInstance` is used for the CommonJS modules.

`makeModuleInstance` 
[module-instance.js:328](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/ses/src/module-instance.js#L328) defines an imports function and passed to the [functor](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/ses/src/module-instance.js#L407), a callable form of the module, when it's invoked inside `execute`.

Functor uses code with import instrumentation, where
```js
import defaultAsName from './module-exports-assigned-object.cjs';
import * as namespaceAsName from './module-exports-assigned-object.cjs';
``` 
got translated to 
```js
(({   imports: $h‚Äç_imports,   liveVar: $h‚Äç_live,   onceVar: $h‚Äç_once,  }) => {   let defaultAsName,namespaceAsName;$h‚Äç_imports([["./module-exports-assigned-object.cjs", [["default", [$h‚Äç_a => (defaultAsName = $h‚Äç_a)]],["*", [$h‚Äç_a => (namespaceAsName = $h‚Äç_a)]]]]]);   
```
`$h‚Äç_imports` is the imports function. Its argument is entries consisting of module specifier and functions to call with each import result.

Each module specifier is used to find the module instance in importedInstances and run its execute()

After execute is done, instance's exports are made reachable externally through notifiers.  
In [module-instance.js:347](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/ses/src/module-instance.js#L347) - expectations from import statements are matched with exports provided by the instance.


What happensnext, in [module-instance.js:354](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/7b2b7206d8ed5f6cb0a0abe0026c5426f9cc8651/packages/ses/src/module-instance.js#L354), is each of the functions passed to import, like `$h‚Äç_a => (namespaceAsName = $h‚Äç_a`, gets passed as argument to a notifier from the module instance that's being imported. They're matched by export name, including `'*'` in this case. Notifier is responsible for calling the function with the appropriate value.

To make `import * from 'a.cjs'` work, `makeThirdPartyModuleInstance` needs to define a notifier for `*` in the map of notifiers.
