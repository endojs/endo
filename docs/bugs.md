# Bug Disclosure

Please help us practice coordinated security bug disclosure, by using the
instructions in our [security guide](https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses/SECURITY.md) to
report security-sensitive bugs privately.

For non-security bugs, please use the [regular Issues
page](https://github.com/Agoric/SES-shim/issues).
