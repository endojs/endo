Hi, I'm a noob. Follow me as I explore the codebase.  

# Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit-Hole to see how CommonJS modules get loaded

Did you read up on what Endo's about? Stuff is running in compartments and these are there to lock things down inside them. 
TODO: link to an intro video or sth

I quickly discovered the thing that's responsible for loading modules with dependencies is called compartment-mapper.

## Hello, compartment-mapper

First I went to https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/master/packages/compartment-mapper/README.md


### console.log first

With that context, it was time to run stuff.  
I started by picking a simple test, then instrumented https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/289c906173a450d608f816ab83e702435ad80057/packages/compartment-mapper/src/parse-cjs.js#L28 by adding a console.log - don't judge.

```js
const execute = async (moduleExports, compartment, resolvedImports) => {
    const a = {};
    Error.captureStackTrace(a);
    console.log(location, a.stack);
    const functor = compartment.evaluate(
```
which I then executed
```
naugtur@localtoast:endo/packages/compartment-mapper $ yarn ava ./test/test-main.js
```
and got stack traces I could explore (some IDEs will navigate to lines when you ctrl/cmd + click on a link in their integrated terminal!)

The result was pretty dull, because most of it was inside the ses.umd.js :(

So I went and replaced `import 'ses'` with `import '../../ses/index.js';`
in test-main.js and also in scaffold.js

That got me the stacktrace I wanted

```
file:///endo/packages/compartment-mapper/test/fixtures-0/node_modules/typemodule/cjs.cjs Error:

â€¦
```

Going through these files reveals a lot about where the packages are loaded. But there was still more I could get out of it.

### I'm a professional, gotta use serious tools!

Ok, so now I shamed myself into getting a debugger connected.  
*This is gonna be a demo of why I prefer to use console.log first...*

I want to plug in a debugger into tests. Ava is not very keen to cooperate. I had issues with the default way ava tests debugging is set up for vscode https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/main/docs/recipes/debugging-with-vscode.md
It'd complain I should be using import() instead of require.

*It's either because of how ava works internally, or because the test is calling require because it's covering cjs modules. Not the rabbithole I'm after right now.*

I put a `debugger;` statement at the beginning of the test so I don't have to go through Ava bootstrap much.

Tests, even if running `ava --serial`, spawn more than one debugger for this test, so the port number must not collide.

I ended up plugging in the debugger with this:
```
node --inspect-brk=0  node_modules/.bin/ava --serial ./test/test-cjs-compat.js
```
(I took the simplest test with cjs I could find)

--inspect-brk=0 gives me a new random port each time.  
I opened chromium devtools and in the Connection tab added a new connection to 127.0.0.1:RANDOM_PORT_I_GOT 
- Connect to the first one and hit play.  
- Look up the next port.  
- Connect to the second one and hit play.  
- Now I'm at my `debugger;`

The fun began! 

----

I went through the `loadLocation` and `import` calls with the debugger.  
**See the [Loading and running - first pass](./docs/loading-code-guide.md) code guide**


My test case didn't load any modules inside packages, so `pendingJobs` was just 1 item and I didn't go on to explore how the recursion creates the jobs.  
I did notice that the recursion is returning results to the main load function by mutating items passed down as references. That's how jobs and errors are collected. 



# Chapter 2: Try to use dynamic import in CJS

In an attempt to compare what structure I'd get from requiring various things, I tried to also pull an .mjs into a CommonJS module. I did it properly, with a dynamic import.  
*After trying `require('./a.mjs')` first, obviously. Why would I remember it's not supported in Node?*

It turned out when I put in:
```js
 const mjsinterop = await import('./mjsinterop.mjs');
```
SES complains
```
SyntaxError: Possible import expression rejected at file://endo/packages/compartment-mapper/test/fixtures-cjs-import-esm/node_modules/app/index.js:17. (SES_IMPORT_REJECTED)

```

A bit of looking around got me to these:
- SES doc on the error: [SES_IMPORT_REJECTED.md](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/505a7d7149c36825a00c9fe3795d0f1588035dde/packages/ses/error-codes/SES_IMPORT_REJECTED.md)
- issue: [import expression false positives #498](https://github.com/endojs/endo/issues/498)

So, there's protections against using the `import` keyword unexpectedly, including in CommonJS modules.  
If I really want to use it I'm supposed to pass `__evadeImportExpressionTest__` as a boolean config option. Nice.  
I decided to create a test for that.

```js
 const application = await loadLocation(read, fixture, {
    __evadeImportExpressionTest__: true,
  });
  await application.import({
    __evadeImportExpressionTest__: true,
  });
```
Unfortunately, none of these worked.

I needed to find a way to pass the option to `evaluate` in [compartment-shim.js:112](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/806521e94c8ba90617344760b3a80412b7a83ab6/packages/ses/src/compartment-shim.js#L112) 

Resued the trick to get the stacktrace to a function and got exactly what I needed

```
...
  const mjsinterop = await import('./mjsinterop.mjs');
  assertInteropNameCollisions({
    name: 'moduleinterops',
    moduleReference: mjsinterop,
    expect: whatWouldNodejsDo,
  })
} //*/
})
//# sourceURL=file://endo/packages/compartment-mapper/test/fixtures-cjs-import-esm/node_modules/app/index.js Error: 
    at Compartment.evaluate (file://endo/packages/ses/src/compartment-shim.js:114:11)
    at Object.execute (file://endo/packages/compartment-mapper/src/parse-cjs.js:32:33)
    at execute (file://endo/packages/ses/src/module-instance.js:87:28)
    at compartmentImportNow (file://endo/packages/ses/src/compartment-shim.js:87:3)
    at file://endo/packages/ses/src/compartment-shim.js:159:27
    at file://endo/packages/compartment-mapper/test/test-cjs-import-esm.js:23:3
```

That was enough to remind me I already saw the evaluate call - in [parse-cjs.js](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/289c906173a450d608f816ab83e702435ad80057/packages/compartment-mapper/src/parse-cjs.js)  
but it won't pass the second argument!

*Should it be configurable?*

The transform to evade issues with import expressions is added in [compartment-evaluate.js:88](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/677141ca56d0749c382ee68d344d1500851da400/packages/ses/src/compartment-evaluate.js#L88) where the only reference to the context of the compartment is privateFields (as compartmentFields) which cover many fields, but not options. [compartment-shim.js:304](https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/806521e94c8ba90617344760b3a80412b7a83ab6/packages/ses/src/compartment-shim.js#L304)

That's when I asked about it and it turns out the protection against using `import` is super important, because otherwise it'd be possible to circumvent some of the protections compartments provide.  
The option to turn on a transform is there but should not be used.

It wasn't a total waste of time - I did learn a bit more about the 2 stages - compartment creation and, later, execution. 

# Chapter 3 - The cjs parser doesn't need to be right to be allright

TBD

# Chapter 4 - Layered cake of indirection 

The time has come for me to figure out how importing cjs modules into esm modules works. 
> spoiler: it didn't

I started by looking at a simple case of

```js
import * as something from 'something.cjs'
```

I ended up finding out that in esm the import keyword is replaced with a function that gets an updater function as an argument and that updater is later wired up with a notifier function whose job it is to pass the right value to the updater when called. 

**See the [Module instance and import](./docs/loading-code-guide.md) code guide**

Without printing the `functorSource` to the console I don't think I'd figure that out.

# Chapter 5 - if only we could parse

cjs-module-analyzer won't identify some fairly popular ways in which require could work

a potential solution is to try to parse require even if we're not in top level. IT covers all occurences of require, but then it introduces the issue of potentially finding a require call that's just a function named that. 
To avoid issues, https://github.com/endojs/endo/blob/a7b42ae2388b232f7daa099495ba11f385010fd1/packages/compartment-mapper/src/import-hook.js#L165 instead of erroring out, it could return a static module record that throws the error when execute is called. that way it'd emulate cjs more closely.

This continued as https://github.com/endojs/endo/issues/1083
# Chapter 6 - a swap partition

I needed to feel the gaps in my mental model of how compartment-mapper and SES work together to load and import dependencies. Couldn't juggle it all in memory, so decided to put it in a swap partition.
