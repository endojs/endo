  // The `@endo/init` package exists so the "main" of production code
  // can start with the following import or its equivalent.
  // ```js
  // import '@endo/init';
  // ```
  // But production code must also be tested. Normal ocap discipline of passing
  // explicit arguments into the `lockdown`
  // call would require an awkward structuring of start modules, since
  // the `init` module calls `lockdown` during its initialization,
  // before any explicit code in the start module gets to run. Even if other code
  // does get to run first, the `lockdown` call in this module happens during
  // module initialization, before it can legitimately receive parameters by
  // explicit parameter passing.
  //
  // Instead, for now, `init` violates normal ocap discipline by feature
  // testing global state for a passed "parameter". This is something that a
  // module can but normally should not do, during initialization or otherwise.
  // Initialization is often awkward.
  //
  // The `init` module tests, first,
  // for a JavaScript global named `LOCKDOWN_OPTIONS`, and second, for an
  // environment
  // variable named `LOCKDOWN_OPTIONS`. If either is present, its value should be
  // a JSON encoding of the options bag to pass to the `lockdown` call. If so,
  // then `init` calls `lockdown` with those options. If there is no such
  // feature, `init` calls `lockdown` with appropriate settings for
  // production use.
