/**
 * This module provides {@link captureFromMap}, which only "captures" the
 * compartment map descriptors and sources from a partially completed
 * compartment map--_without_ creating an archive. The resulting compartment map
 * represents a well-formed dependency graph, laden with useful metadata. This,
 * for example, could be used for automatic policy generation.
 *
 * The resulting data structure ({@link CaptureResult}) contains a
 * mapping of filepaths to compartment map names.
 *
 * These functions do not have a bias for any particular mapping, so you will
 * need to use `mapNodeModules` from `@endo/compartment-map/node-modules.js` or
 * a similar device to construct one. The default `parserForLanguage` mapping is
 * empty. You will need to provide the `defaultParserForLanguage` from
 * `@endo/compartment-mapper/import-parsers.js` or
 * `@endo/compartment-mapper/archive-parsers.js`.
 *
 * If you use `@endo/compartment-mapper/archive-parsers.js`, the archive will
 * contain pre-compiled ESM and CJS modules wrapped in a JSON envelope, suitable
 * for use with the SES shim in any environment including a web page, without a
 * client-side dependency on Babel.
 *
 * If you use `@endo/compartment-mapper/import-parsers.js`, the archive will
 * contain original sources, so to import the archive with
 * `src/import-archive-lite.js`, you will need to provide the archive parsers
 * and entrain a runtime dependency on Babel.

/**
 * We attempt to produce compartment maps that are consistent regardless of
 * whether the packages were originally laid out on disk for development or
 * production, and other trivia like the fully qualified path of a specific
 * installation.
 *
 * Naming compartments for the self-ascribed name and version of each Node.js
 * package is insufficient because they are not guaranteed to be unique.
 * Dependencies do not necessarilly come from the npm registry and may be
 * for example derived from fully qualified URL's or Github org and project
 * names.
 * Package managers are also not required to fully deduplicate the hard
 * copy of each package even when they are identical resources.
 * Duplication is undesirable, but we elect to defer that problem to solutions
 * in the package managers, as the alternative would be to consistently hash
 * the original sources of the packages themselves, which may not even be
 * available much less pristine for us.
 *
 * So, instead, we use the lexically least path of dependency names, delimited
 * by hashes.
 * The compartment maps generated by the ./node-modules.js tooling pre-compute
 * these traces for our use here.
 * We sort the compartments lexically on their self-ascribed name and version,
 * and use the lexically least dependency name path as a tie-breaker.
 * The dependency path is logical and orthogonal to the package manager's
 * actual installation location, so should be orthogonal to the vagaries of the
 * package manager's deduplication algorithm.
 *
