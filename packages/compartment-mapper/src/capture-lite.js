/**
 *
 * This module provides {@link captureFromMap}, which only "captures" the
 * compartment map descriptors and sources from a partially completed
 * compartment map--_without_ creating an archive. The resulting compartment map
 * represents a well-formed dependency graph, laden with useful metadata. This,
 * for example, could be used for automatic policy generation.
 *
 * The resulting data structure ({@link CaptureResult}) contains a
 * mapping of filepaths to compartment map names.
 *
 * These functions do not have a bias for any particular mapping, so you will
 * need to use `mapNodeModules` from `@endo/compartment-map/node-modules.js` or
 * a similar device to construct one. The default `parserForLanguage` mapping is
 * empty. You will need to provide the `defaultParserForLanguage` from
 * `@endo/compartment-mapper/import-parsers.js` or
 * `@endo/compartment-mapper/archive-parsers.js`.
 *
 * If you use `@endo/compartment-mapper/archive-parsers.js`, the archive will
 * contain pre-compiled ESM and CJS modules wrapped in a JSON envelope, suitable
 * for use with the SES shim in any environment including a web page, without a
 * client-side dependency on Babel.
 *
 * If you use `@endo/compartment-mapper/import-parsers.js`, the archive will
 * contain original sources, so to import the archive with
 * `src/import-archive-lite.js`, you will need to provide the archive parsers
 * and entrain a runtime dependency on Babel.
