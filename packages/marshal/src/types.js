/**

 *
 * This comparison function is valid as argument to
 * `Array.prototype.sort`. This is sometimes described as a "total order"
 * but, depending on your definitions, this is technically incorrect because
 * it may return `0` to indicate that two distinguishable elements such as
 * `-0` and `0` are tied (i.e., are in the same equivalence class
 * for the purposes of this ordering). If each such equivalence class is
 * a *rank* and ranks are disjoint, then this "rank order" is a
 * true total order over these ranks. In mathematics this goes by several
 * other names such as "total preorder".
 *
 * This function establishes a total rank order over all passables.
 * To do so it makes arbitrary choices, such as that all strings
 * are after all numbers. Thus, this order is not intended to be
 * used directly as a comparison with useful semantics. However, it must be
 * closely enough related to such comparisons to aid in implementing
 * lookups based on those comparisons. For example, in order to get a total
 * order among ranks, we put `NaN` after all other JavaScript "number" values
 * (i.e., IEEE 754 floating-point values). But otherwise, we rank JavaScript
 * numbers by signed magnitude, with `0` and `-0` tied. A semantically useful
 * ordering would also compare magnitudes, and so agree with the rank ordering
 * of all values other than `NaN`. An array sorted by rank would enable range
 * queries by magnitude.

/**

 * `FullCompare(x, y) === 0` iff `KeyCompare(x, y) === 0`.
 *
 * For non-keys a `FullCompare` should be exactly as imprecise as
 * `RankCompare`. For example, both will treat all errors as in the same
 * equivalence class. Both will treat all promises as in the same
 * equivalence class. Both will order taggeds the same way, which is admittedly
 * weird, as some taggeds will be considered keys and other taggeds will be
 * considered non-keys.
