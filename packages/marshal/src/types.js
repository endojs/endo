/**

 * As a total preorder, this comparison function is valid as an argument to

 * distinguishable elements such as `-0` and `0` are tied (i.e., are in the same

 *
 * This function establishes a total rank order over all passables.
 * To do so it makes arbitrary choices, such as that all strings
 * are after all numbers, and thus is not intended to be used directly as a
 * comparison with useful semantics.
 * However, it must be closely enough related to such comparisons to aid in
 * implementing lookups based on those comparisons.
 * For example, in order to get a total order over ranks, we put `NaN` after all
 * other JavaScript "number" values (i.e., IEEE 754 floating-point values) but
 * otherwise rank JavaScript numbers by signed magnitude, with `0` and `-0`
 * tied, as would a semantically useful ordering such as `KeyCompare` in

 * Likewise, an array sorted by rank would enable range queries by magnitude.
