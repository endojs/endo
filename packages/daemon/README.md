# Endo Daemon

This package provides the Endo daemon and controller.
The controller manages the Endo daemon lifecycle.

The Endo daemon is a persistent host for managing guest programs in hardened
JavaScript worker processes.
The daemon communicates through a Unix domain socket or named pipe associated
with the user, and manages per-user storage and compute access.

Over that channel, the daemon communicates in CapTP over netstring message
envelopes.
The bootstrap provides the user agent API from which one can derive facets for
other agents.

## Gateway

The daemon runs a unified HTTP/WebSocket gateway server.
Set the `ENDO_ADDR` environment variable before running `endo start` to control the listen address and port (default `127.0.0.1:8920`).

```sh
ENDO_ADDR=127.0.0.1:9000 endo start
```

### Remote access

By default the gateway only accepts WebSocket connections from localhost
(`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `::ffff:127.0.0.1`).  Connections from any other
client IP are closed with `"Only local connections allowed"`.

To accept connections from non-localhost clients (for example, over a VPN or
LAN), you must both **bind to a reachable interface** via `ENDO_ADDR` and
**opt in** with one of the two environment variables below.

#### Allow all remote connections

Set `ENDO_GATEWAY_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` to disable the client-IP check entirely.
Every address that can reach the gateway port will be allowed through.

```sh
ENDO_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8920 ENDO_GATEWAY_ALLOW_REMOTE=1 endo start
```

#### Allow specific IP ranges (CIDR allowlist)

Set `ENDO_GATEWAY_ALLOWED_CIDRS` to a comma-separated list of CIDRs.
Localhost is always allowed in addition to the listed ranges.

```sh
ENDO_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8920 \
  ENDO_GATEWAY_ALLOWED_CIDRS="10.0.0.0/8,100.64.0.0/10" \
  endo start
```

Both IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs are supported.  A bare address without a `/prefix`
is treated as a host route (`/32` for IPv4, `/128` for IPv6).  Invalid
entries are silently ignored.

IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:10.1.2.3`) are normalized before
matching, so an IPv4 CIDR like `10.0.0.0/8` will match connections that
arrive as `::ffff:10.x.x.x`.

#### Common CIDR examples

| Range | Description |
|---|---|
| `10.0.0.0/8` | RFC 1918 private (Class A) |
| `172.16.0.0/12` | RFC 1918 private (Class B) |
| `192.168.0.0/16` | RFC 1918 private (Class C) |
| `100.64.0.0/10` | CGNAT / Tailscale |
| `fd00::/8` | IPv6 unique local addresses |

> **Security note:** These options control which client IPs may establish a
> WebSocket connection to the gateway.  They do not add authentication or
> encryption.  Use a VPN or other transport-layer protection when exposing
> the gateway beyond localhost.
