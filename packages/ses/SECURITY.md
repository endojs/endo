## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please help us practice coordinated security bug disclosure. If you find a
security-sensitive bug that should not be revealed publically until a fix is
available, please send email to `security` at (@) `agoric.com`. To encrypt,
please use my (@warner) personal GPG key [A476E2E6 11880C98 5B3C3A39 0386E81B
11CAA07A](http://www.lothar.com/warner-gpg.html) . Keybase users can also
send messages to `@agoric_security`, or share code and other log files via
the Keybase encrypted file system
(`/keybase/private/agoric_security,$YOURNAME`).

We will create a GitHub security advisory promptly. Let us know your GitHub
username and we'll add you to the collaborator list for further discussion.
