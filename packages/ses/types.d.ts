// strike a good balance in distinguishing "readonly" in the sense that you

// not changing.
// type Hardened<T> =
//   T extends number | bigint | string | null | undefined | Function ? T :
//   { readonly [P in keyof T]: Hardened<T[P]> };

// keep the type info in those casts so it is easily comparable by eye to
