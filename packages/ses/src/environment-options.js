/**
 * JavaScript module semantics resists attempts to parameterize a module's
 * initialization behavior. A module initializes in order according to
 * the path by which it is first imported, and then the initialized module
 * is reused by all the other times it is imported. Compartments give us
 * the opportunity to bind the same import name to different imported
 * modules, depending on the package/compartment doing the import. Compartments
 * also address the difficulty of parameterizing a module's initialization
 * logic, but not in a pleasant manner.
 *
 * A pleasant parameterization would be for a static module to be function-like
 * with explicit parameters, and for the parameterization to be like
 * calling the static module with parameters in order to derive from it a
 * module instance. Compartments instead lets us parameterize the meaning
 * of a module instance derived from a static module according to the
 * three namespaces provided by the JavaScript semantics, affecting the
 * meaning of a module instance.
 *    * The global variable namespaces.
 *       * The global scope, aliased to properties of the global object.
 *         This is necessarily compartment-wide, and therefore in our
 *         recommened usage pattern, package-wide.
 *       * The global lexical scope. The SES-shim compartments support
 *         these both compartment-wide as well as per-module. But it is
 *         not yet clear what we will propose in the Compartment proposal.
 *    * The import namespace.
 *    * The host hooks.
 *
 * This `environment-options.js` module looks for a setting of an
 * `optionName` parameter rooted in the global scope. If follows the Node
 * precedent for finding Unix environment variable settings, looking for a
 * global `process` object holding an `env` object,
 * optionally holding a property named for the `optionName` whose value is the
 * configuration setting of that option. For example, for the optionName
 * `FOO_BAR` it would look in
 * `globalThis.process.env.FOO_BAR`.
 *
 * If setting is either absent or `undefined`, that indicates that
 * this configuration option should have its default behavior, whatever that is.
 * Otherwise, reflecting Unix environment variables, the setting must be a
 * string. This also helps ensure that this channel is used only to pass data,
 * not authority beyond the ability to read this global state.
