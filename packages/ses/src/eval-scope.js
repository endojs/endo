// We attempt to frustrate stack bumping attacks on the safe evaluator
// (`make-safe-evaluator.js`).
// A stack bumping attack forces an API call to throw a stack overflow
// `RangeError` at an inopportune time.
// The attacker arranges for the stack to be sufficiently deep that the API
// consumes exactly enough stack frames to throw an exception.
//
// For the safe evaluator, an exception thrown between adding and then deleting
// `eval` on `evalScope` could leak the real `eval` to an attacker's lexical
// scope.
// This would be sufficiently disastrous that we guard against it twice.
// First, we delete `eval` from `evalScope` immediately before rendering it to
// the guest program's lexical scope.
//
// If the attacker manages to arrange for `eval` to throw an exception after we
// call `allowNextEvalToBeUnsafe` but before the guest program accesses `eval`,
// it would be able to access `eval` once more in its own code.
// Although they could do no harm with a direct `eval`, they would be able to
// escape to the true global scope with an indirect `eval`.
//
//   prepareStack(depth, () => {
//     (eval)('');
//   });
//   const unsafeEval = (eval);
//   const safeEval = (eval);
//   const realGlobal = unsafeEval('globalThis');
//
// To protect against that case, we also delete `eval` from the `evalScope` in
// a `finally` block surrounding the call to the safe evaluator.
// The only way to reach this case is if `eval` remains on `evalScope` due to
// an attack, so we assume that attack would have have invalided our isolation
// and revoke all future access to the evaluator.
//
// To defeat a stack bumping attack, we must use fewer stack frames to recover
// in that `finally` block than we used in the `try` block.
// We have no reliable guarantees about how many stack frames a block of
// JavaScript will consume.
// Function inlining, tail-call optimization, variations in the size of a stack
// frame, and block scopes may affect the depth of the stack.
// The only number of acceptable stack frames to use in the finally block is
// zero.
// We only use property assignment and deletion in the safe evaluator's
// `finally` block.
// We use `delete evalScope.eval` to withhold the evaluator.
// We assign an envelope object over `evalScopeKit.revoked` to revoke the
// evaluator.
//
// This is why we supply a meaningfully named function for
// `allowNextEvalToBeUnsafe` but do not provide a corresponding
// `revokeAccessToUnsafeEval` or even simply `revoke`.
// These recovery routines are expressed inline in the safe evaluator.
