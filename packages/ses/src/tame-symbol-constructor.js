/**
 * This taming provides a tamed alternative to the original `Symbol` constructor
 * that starts off identical, except that all its properties are "temporarily"
 * configurable. The original `Symbol` constructor remains unmodified on
 * the start compartment's global. The tamed alternative is used as the shared
 * `Symbol` constructor on constructed compartments.
 *
 * Starting these properties as configurable assumes two succeeding phases of
 * processing: A whitelisting phase, that
 * removes all properties not on the whitelist (which requires them to be
 * configurable) and a global hardening step that freezes all primordials,
 * returning these properties to their expected non-configurable status.
 *
 * The ses shim is constructed to eventually enable vetted shims to run between
 * repair and global hardening. However, such vetted shims would normally
 * run in the start compartment, which continues to use the original unmodified
 * `Symbol`, so they should not normally be affected by the temporary
 * configurability of these properties.
 *
 * Note that the spec refers to the global `Symbol` function as the
 * ["Symbol Constructor"](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/fundamental-objects.html#sec-symbol-constructor)
 * even though it has a call behavior (can be called as a function) and does not
 * not have a construct behavior (cannot be called with `new`). Accordingly,
 * to tame it, we must replace it with a function without a construct
 * behavior.
