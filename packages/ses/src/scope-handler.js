/*
 * createScopeHandler()
 * ScopeHandler manages a Proxy which serves as the global scope for the
 * performEval operation (the Proxy is the argument of a 'with' binding).
 * As described in createSafeEvaluator(), it has several functions:
 * - allow the very first (and only the very first) use of 'eval' to map to
 * the real (unsafe) eval function, so it acts as a 'direct eval' and can
 * access its lexical scope (which maps to the 'with' binding, which the
 * ScopeHandler also controls).
 * - ensure that all subsequent uses of 'eval' map to the safeEvaluator,
 * which lives as the 'eval' property of the safeGlobal.
 * - route all other property lookups at the safeGlobal.
 * - hide the unsafeGlobal which lives on the scope chain above the 'with'.
 * - ensure the Proxy invariants despite some global properties being frozen.
