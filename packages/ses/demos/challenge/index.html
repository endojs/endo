    <h1>Hardened JavaScript Escape Room</h1>
    <p>In this challenge, the defender has a secret
      “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macguffin">MacGuffin</a>”, in this
      case a random code which the attacker (below) is trying to guess. Everything
      is running inside a single locked-down SES Realm. The attacker’s code (pasted into
      the text box) is evaluated by the defender in a separate Compartment when the Execute button is
    pressed.</p>
    <p>The secret consists of a ten-character alphanumeric code (about 52 bits of
      entropy). The attacker’s program gets a “check my guess” function, which
      returns a Promise that fires with true for a correct guess and false for a
      wrong one. If the program guesses correctly, red lights flash and the
    attacker wins.</p>
    <p>To make things easier for our attacker, we’ve added a classic timing
      side-channel. Our check function tests one character at a time, and takes 10
      milliseconds for each comparison. An attacker with full access to a clock
      would try all possible values for the first character and see which one takes
      the least time, concluding that the full password must start with that
      character. Then they iterate on the second character, and so on until they’ve
    worked out the full password, roughly 18 seconds later.</p>
    <p>However a SES-confined program only gets to access non-determinism in the start
    Compartment (the one that ran <code>lockdown()</code>), so this attacker
      doesn’t get a clock, and cannot read from the covert channel. Load this page
      <a href="?dateNow=enabled">with ?dateNow=enabled</a> to demonstrate the
      attack with <code>Date.now</code> enabled, or <a href="?dateNow=disabled">with
      ?dateNow=disabled</a> to properly confine the attacker.</p>
      <p>The defender running in the start Compartment gets access to powerful JS
      globals.  This includes sources of non-determinism like
      <code>window.setTimeout</code> and
      <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues</code> as well as the DOM.</p>
