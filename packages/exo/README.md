# `@endo/exo`

An Exo object is an exposed Remotable object with methods (aka a Far object) which is defined with an InterfaceGuard as a protective outer layer, providing the first layer of defensiveness.

This `@endo/exo` package defined the APIs for making Exo objects, and for defining ExoClasses and ExoClassKits for making Exo objects.

See [exo-taxonomy](./docs/exo-taxonomy.md) for the taxonomy and naming conventions for the elements of this API.
