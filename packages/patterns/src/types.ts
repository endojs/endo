/**
 * Keys are Passable arbitrarily-nested pass-by-copy containers
 * (CopyArray, CopyRecord, CopySet, CopyBag, CopyMap) in which every
 * non-container leaf is either a Passable primitive value or a Remotable (a
 * remotely-accessible object or presence for a remote object), or such leaves
 * in isolation with no container.
 *
 * Keys are so named because they can be used as keys in CopyMaps and
 * [agoric-sdk Stores](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/blob/master/packages/store/docs/store-taxonomy.md),
 * and as elements in CopySets and CopyBags.
 *
 * Keys cannot contain promises or errors, as these do not have useful
 * distributed equality semantics. Keys also cannot contain any CopyTagged
 * except for those recognized as CopySets, CopyBags, and CopyMaps.
 *
 * Be aware that we may recognize more CopyTaggeds over time, including
 * CopyTaggeds recognized as Keys.
 *
 * Distributed equality is location independent.
 * The same two Keys, passed to another location, will be {@link keyEQ} there iff
 * they are {@link keyEQ} here. ({@link keyEQ} tests equality according to the
 * key distributed equality semantics.)
 *
 * ### Rank order and key order
 *
 * The "key order" of `compareKeys` implements a partial order over Keys --- it defines relative position between two Keys but leaves some pairs incomparable (for example, subsets over sets is a partial order in which {} precedes {x} and {y}, which are mutually incomparable but both precede {x, y}).
 * It is co-designed with the "rank order" (a total preorder) of `compareRank` from [`@endo/marshal`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@endo/marshal) to support efficient range search for Key-based queries (for example, finding all entries in a map for which the key is a CopyRecord with particular fields can be implemented by selecting from rank-ordered keys those that are CopyRecords whose lexicographically greatest field is at least as big as the lexicographically greatest required field, and then filtering out matched keys that don't have the necessary shape).
 * Both functions use `-1`, `0`, and `1` to respectively mean "less than", "equivalent to", and "greater than".
 * `NaN` means "incomparable" --- the first key is not less than, equivalent to, or greater than the second.
 * To keep the orders distinct when speaking informally, we use "earlier" and "later" for rank order, and "smaller" and "bigger" for key order.
 *
 * The key ordering of `compareKeys` refines the rank ordering of `compareRank` but leaves gaps for which a more complete "full order" relies upon rank ordering:
 * 1. `compareKeys(X,Y) === 0` implies that `compareRank(X,Y) === 0` --- if X
 *    is equivalent to Y in key order, then X is equivalent to Y in rank order.
 *    But the converse does not hold; for example, Remotables `Far('X')` and
 *    `Far('Y')` are equivalent in rank order but incomparable in key order.
 * 2. `compareKeys(X,Y) < 0` implies that `compareRank(X,Y) < 0` --- if X is
 *    smaller than Y in key order, then X is earlier than Y in rank order.
 *    But the converse does not hold; for example, the record `{b: 3, a: 5}`
 *    is earlier than the record `{b: 5, a: 3}` in rank order but they are
 *    incomparable in key order.
 * 3. `compareRank(X,Y) === 0` implies that `compareKeys(X,Y)` is either
 *    0 or NaN --- Keys within the same rank are either equivalent to or
 *    incomparable to each other in key order. But the converse does not hold;
 *    for example, `Far('X')` and `{}` are incomparable in key order but not
 *    equivalent in rank order.
 * 4. `compareRank(X,Y) === 0` and `compareRank(X,Z) === 0` imply that
 *    `compareKeys(X,Y)` and `compareKeys(X,Z)` are the same --- all Keys within
 *    the same rank are either mutually equivalent or mutually incomparable, and
 *    in fact only in the mutually incomparable case can the rank be said to
 *    contain more than one key.

/**
 * Patterns are Passable arbitrarily-nested pass-by-copy containers
 * (CopyArray, CopyRecord, CopySet, CopyBag, CopyMap) in which every
 * non-container leaf is either a Key or a {@link Matcher}, or such leaves in
 * isolation with no container.
 *
 * A Pattern acts as a declarative total predicate over Passables, where each
 * Passable is either matched or not matched by it. Every {@link Key} is also a Pattern
 * that matches only "itself", i.e., Keys that are {@link keyEQ} to it according to
 * the key distributed equality semantics.
 *
 * Patterns cannot contain promises or errors, as these do
 * not have useful distributed equality or matching semantics. Likewise,
 * no Pattern can distinguish among promises, or distinguish among errors.
 * Patterns also cannot contain any CopyTaggeds except for those recognized as
 * {@link CopySet}s, {@link CopyBag}s, {@link CopyMap}s, or {@link Matcher}s.
 *
 * Be aware that we may recognize more CopyTaggeds over time, including
 * CopyTaggeds recognized as Patterns.
 *
 * Whether a Passable is matched by a given Pattern is location independent.
 * If a given Passable and Pattern are passed to another location,
 * the Passable will be matched by the Pattern there iff the Passable is matched
 * by the Pattern here.
 *
 * Patterns are often used in a type-like manner, to represent the category
 * of Passables that the Pattern is intended* to match. To keep this
 * distinction clear, we often use the suffix "Shape" rather than "Pattern"
 * to avoid confusion when the Pattern itself represents
 * some category of Pattern. For example, an "AmountShape" represents the
 * category of Amounts. And "AmountPatternShape" represents the
 * category of Patterns over Amounts.
 *
 * * We say "intended" above because Patterns, in order to be declarative
 * and Passable, cannot have the generality of predicates written in a
 * Turing-universal programming language. Rather, to represent the category of
 * things intended to be a Foo, a FooShape should reliably
 * accept all Foos and reject only non-Foos. However, a FooShape may also accept
 * non-Foos that "look like" or "have the same shape as" genuine Foos.
 * An accurate predicate for e.g. input validation would need to supplement the
 * Pattern check with code to detect the residual cases.
 * We hope the "Shape" metaphor helps remind us of this type-like imprecision
 * of Patterns.
