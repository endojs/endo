User-visible changes in SES-Ava:

# Next release
* Support the full ava API ([#1235](https://github.com/endojs/endo/issues/1235))

# 0.2.0 (2021-06-01)

* *BREAKING*: Removes CommonJS and UMD downgrade compatibility.
  Supporting both Node.js ESM and the `node -r esm` shim requires the main
  entry point module to be ESM regardless of environment.
  UMD and CommonJS facets will likely return after all dependees have migrated
  away from depending upon the `esm` JavaScript module emulator.
* Expose internal `package.json` through Node.js ESM `exports` for the benefit
  of `svelte` tooling.
