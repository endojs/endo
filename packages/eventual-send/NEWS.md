User-visible changes in eventual-send:

# Next release

- *BREAKING*: Disallow using E proxy methods as functions.
  Enforces the `E(x).foo()` calling convention and disallows using as bound
  methods. Constructs like `const foo = E(x).foo; foo()` now cause a rejection.

# v0.14.2 (2022-01-25)

- Eventual send now hardens arguments and results (values and errors).


# v0.14.1 (2022-01-22)

Moved from https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk to
https://github.com/endojs/endo.


# Unknown version

Removed obsolete `HandledPromise.unwrap` and `E.unwrap` functions.


# v0.5.0 (2019-12-17)

Implement updated `HandledPromise` interface:

- use `new HandledPromise(...args)` instead of `Promise.makeHandled(...args)`
- use `HandledPromise.resolve(x)` (exported also as `E.resolve(x)`) which
  returns x if it is already a HandledPromise or Promise, or x's corresponding
  HandledPromise, or a new HandledPromise
- the promise handler now uses `get` instead of `GET` and `applyMethod` instead of `POST`
- delete, has, and set traps and their corresponding `E` operations have been removed as per the spec
- the `E.C` experimental "eventual chain" proxy has been removed
