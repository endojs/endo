# test262-runner

Run ECMAScript compliance tests on Node.js, XS, and potentially others, with a
prelude that shims Hardened JavaScript on these platforms.

## Test262 subset

The `test262` directory contains

* a copy of the `tests` and `harness` directories from https://github.com/tc39/test262.
* additional tests from https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable
* additional Hardened JavaScript tests

We currently only run tests expressly marked with the `ses-xs-parity` feature
in their front-matter.

## Justification

Maintaining a local copy of tests taken at a given revision provides not only stability, it's also much faster on autobuilds than having to both checkout the test262 git repo and filter for relevant tests, and having to do so at every test run.

This technique is the same used by all major JavaScript engines:
- https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/tree/master/JSTests/test262
- https://github.com/v8/v8/tree/master/test/test262
- https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/tree/master/js/src/tests/test262
etc.
