# `@endo/far`: Endo Far Object helpers

The `@endo/far` package provides a convenient way to use the Endo
[distributed objects system](https://docs.agoric.com/guides/js-programming/)
without relying on the underlying messaging implementation.

It exists to reduce the boilerplate in Hardened JavaScript vats that are running
in Agoric's SwingSet kernel,
[`@agoric/swingset-vat`](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/tree/master/packages/SwingSet),
or arbitrary JS programs using Hardened JavaScript and communicating via
[`@endo/captp`](../captp/README.md).

You can import any of the following from `@endo/far`:

```js
import { E, Far, getInterfaceOf, passStyleOf } from '@endo/far';
```
